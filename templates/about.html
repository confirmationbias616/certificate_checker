            The idea behind this tool is to minimize subcontractors' average wait
            time for receiving their hard-earned 10% holdback payemnts. This is
            acheived by monitoring all known commercial news websites for
            postings of CSP (Certificate of Substantial Completion) and notify
            involved subcontractors. Applicable to all construction projects in
            Ontario, Canada.

            The '<b>HBR</b>' stands for <b>H</b>old<b>b</b>ack <b>R</b>elease. The
            word 'Bot' intends to communicate that the matching algorithm in the backend
            makes use of machine learning technology. This means that the service will
            automatically improve with time as it sees more data come through. For more
            details on the tech stack, see last paragraph.

            To get started, simply enter a new project and let HBR Bot guide you through 
            the process. To learn more about the Lien Construction Act and holdback

            As for the <b>tech stack</b>, HBR Bot is written in Python and SQL. It essentially
            consists of a machine learning model wrapped in a web app. At a high level,
            the type of data science problem being solved here can be classified as
            <a href='http://www.datacommunitydc.org/blog/2013/08/entity-resolution-for-big-data'>
                Entity Resoultion</a>.
            The machine learning model is a Scikit-Learn Random Forest and it makes use of
            an active style of learning with human-in-the-loop validation via user feedback
            from the web app. Due to the class imbalance issue of an initially small amount
            of confirmed positive matches, the ML training process makes use of the SMOTE
            algorithm. The data wrangling step utilizes the fuzzywuzzy package, which
            applies fuzzy logic to all string mtaching. The web app is built with Flask and is
            hosted on PythonAnywhere. The database is SQLite3. The code base is version
            controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub. It is also automatically tested and
            continuously integrated on CircleCI.
