        The idea behind this tool is to minimize subcontractors' average wait
        time for receiving their hard-earned 10% holdback payemnts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is acheived by monitoring all known commercial news websites for
        postings of CSP (Certificate of Substantial Completion) and notify
        involved subcontractors.

        The 'HBR' in HBR Bot stand for HoldBack Release. The use of the
        word 'Bot' intends to communicate that machine learning plays a big role
        in the backgroung (which it actually does!)
